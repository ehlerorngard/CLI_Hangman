# Command-Line Hangman

This is a simple hangman game built to be played in the console using node.js.  


### Prerequisites

You'll need node and node package manager. 


### Dependencies

To run this app you'll need just two packages installed:  inquirer and chalk.  

Inquirer prompts and takes user input, chalk simply adds color (literally).  

At the directory's root after cloning down the repository, enter in the terminal:

```
npm install inquirer
npm install chalk
```


## Running the App

Simply open the file 'index.js' using node in the terminal.  

Game hint:  the words are all trees ;)
