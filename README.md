# HangmanV2

This is a simple hangman game built to be played in the console using node.js.  


It is available from my GitHub account at https://github.com/ehlerorngard/HangmanV2.  


### Prerequisites

You'll need node package manager. 


### Dependencies

To run this app you'll need just two packages installed:  inquirer and chalk.  

At the directory's root after cloning down the repository, enter in the terminal:

```
npm install inquirer
npm install chalk
```


## Running the App

Simply open the file 'index.js' in the terminal.  

Game hint:  the words are all trees ;)  

### Final Note

The code isn't the easiest-reading...  My endeavor to follow the stipulated istructions (at least as I interpreted them) for this assignment led the code in a very un-dry direction... :-/
